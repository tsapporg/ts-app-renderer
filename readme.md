## ts-app-renderer
**This source code is experimental and a WIP.**

This package is responsible for defining our application renderer. Our application renderer is an attempt at an abstraction of common WebGL/WebGPU libraries. It works in the browser as well as in Node.js.

See [https://github.com/tsapporg/ts-app-docs](https://github.com/tsapporg/ts-app-docs) for documentation.
