## ts-app-renderer
**This source code is experimental and a WIP.**

This package is responsible for defining our application renderer. Our application renderer is an abstraction of common WebGL/WebGPU libraries.

See [https://github.com/tsapporg/ts-app-docs](https://github.com/tsapporg/ts-app-docs) for documentation.
